<!-- Since the base.html template will now take care of the general page structure we have removed those elements from this one
and left only the content part. The extends block establishes the inheritance link between the two templates, so that Jinja2
knows that when it needs to render index.html it needs to include it inside base.html. The two templates have matching block
statements with name content, and this is how Jinja2 knows how to combine the two into one. When we get to write new templates
we will also create them as extensions to base.html. -->

{% extends "base.html" %} {% block content %}
<h1>Hi, {{ user.nickname }}!</h1>
{% for post in posts %}
<div>
    <p>{{ post.author.nickname }} says: <b>{{ post.body }}</b></p>
</div>
{% endfor %} {% endblock %}
